                                    The world today is a world where centralization has been 
                                    impregnated into society over several economic stages in human 
                                    history, which have all led to today's fractional banking policies 
                                    that dominate worldwide, and is largely the cause of all the wars 
                                    and suffering we see.

                                <h3>Kublai Khan & Paper Money</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Under the Mongolian empire, Genghis Khan's predecessor, Kublai Khan, issued 
                                    two different Jiaochaos(notes representing value). The first one he released 
                                    in July of 1260, which was backed by silk, and was unsuccessful. The second 
                                    one he released was in October of the same year, which was successful and 
                                    backed by silver.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It was the first ever paper currency to be used as the predominant 
                                    circulating medium in China's history(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaochao). 
                                    This was a catalyst that led to a financial boom in China, and is in many 
                                    regards what sparked the issuance of notes for many other countries across 
                                    the world, as they began to adopt similar standards.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The British pound(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling) was for example 
                                    during various times backed by either silver or gold.

                                    In later times, the <strong>Medici family</strong>(13th-15th century), a powerful banking 
                                    family and political dynasty, invented the <strong>double entry booking system</strong> 
                                    that allowed them to track credits and debits. Together with other thriving 
                                    families in northern Italy at the time, they inspired and sparked the 
                                    Italian Renaissance. Their bank was the largest in Europe during the 15th 
                                    century, and they were for a long time considered the richest family in 
                                    Europe.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Medici)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In more recent times, Richard Nixon made maybe the most significant move to shift 
                                    us to where we are today with modern banking(which many economists have deemed: 
                                    "A failed and catastrophic experiment for the world and the U.S in particular", 
                                    see: https://bit.ly/2YTP4Gu), by removing the U.S from the gold standard in 1971, 
                                    and effectively allowing for the unlimited printing of money to take place.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But of course, long before any of these, there were the <strong>Egyptians</strong>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Who began with grain banks, where grain harvesters could deposit grain into them 
                                    for security and convenience. The depositors could then withdraw a particular lot 
                                    of grain when they wanted to make a purchase. Mostly this was voluntarily, 
                                    but sometimes they were required by the King to make deposits.

                                    Later they moved onto a more complex bartering system, where people would 
                                    gather in public marketplaces to trade their goods directly with one another. 
                                    Only around 500 BC did the Egyptians move onto metals and producing coins.

                                <h3>The Greeks (7th century BC Archaic period)</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Then there were the Greeks who's history can be divided into the Archaic, 
                                    the Classical, the Hellenic and then the Roman. The Archaic period extends 
                                    from the introduction of coinage to the Greek world during the 7th century 
                                    BC, until the Persian wars in about 480 BC. And it was during the beginning 
                                    of this period that they began producing and using coins; 200 years before 
                                    the Egyptians.(https://bit.ly/2KxTqy6)
                                </p>
                                <h3>The Romans</h3>
                                <p>
                                    And lastly there was the Romans, who absorbed Greece in the 1st century BC, 
                                    the coins produced in Greece during this period were called Greek Imperial 
                                    Coins, or Roman provincial coins. The Romans went on to produce coins and 
                                    create various forms of propaganda through their usage, and primarily for 
                                    the Roman Empires expansion. One of these was printing the Roman Emperors 
                                    portraits on the coins, which is often how the populace learned of a new 
                                    Emperor. Some of the emperors who ruled only for a short time made sure 
                                    that a coin bore their image, only furthering their usage and implementation 
                                    as a propaganda tool.

                                    After Nixon's failed experiment, and directly(/shortly?/) after the 
                                    financial crisis in 2008, where the likes of giants like the Lehman 
                                    Brothers($ 639 billion in assets) went under, having to file for 
                                    bankruptcy and having entire buildings being emptied (of employees) 
                                    on the same day. Subsequently causing huge ripples across economies 
                                    all over the world, mainly affecting: Ireland, Spain, Iceland, Portugal, 
                                    Greece and Italy.

                                    In the middle of all this, a person(or persons), released in complete 
                                    silence the world's first digital currency: Bitcoin(https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

                                    Satoshi Nakamoto solved what many had struggled with for centuries: the Byzantine 
                                    Generals problem(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault). One could suddenly 
                                    trade without a trusted 3rd party in the middle governing, and ultimately 
                                    taking(what in later history has been deemed) an unjustifiable cut of the trade. 
                                    A system that ultimately was far more efficient, cheap, global and near instant. 
                                    Allowing anyone to suddenly become a worldwide banker.

                                    this. A system which requires no paper work, no ID's, no contracts to be signed,

                                    Bitcoin indeed was, and still is a revolutionary technology. It is meant to 
                                    free humanity from the system that currently governs us on a worldwide scale.

                                    And the more people who switch to it, the more likely we will see a future 
                                    where rights have been returned to the individual, on the scale of masses.

                                    Because for so long banking cartels have been leading the world through their 
                                    lobbying and insider deals, breaking rules and not risking individual punishment, 
                                    but rather allowing for a system where fines are distributed, news covers are 
                                    made(for a day), and it takes it's backseat in the stream of news we get 
                                    delivered 24/7.
                                </p>

                                    Bitcoin as we can see, is the world's first nearly completely decentralized 
                                    form of currency. Due to it's PoW structure though, it cannot be, 
                                    and will not ever be completely decentralized. Nor, as any observant 
                                    investor would know, it is not anonymous at all.

                                    In fact, Bitcoin is the most transparent chain on the planet, and it is 
                                    mainly because of this, that it has been able to become so popular. 
                                    There was a way to verify that a transaction had taken place, done by 
                                    reading data directly from the chain(which you can find everywhere online).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The problem with anonymous chains was that you could never verify on a
