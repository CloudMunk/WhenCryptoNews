                          <h1>Privacy & The Battles That Lie Ahead</h1>
                <p>
                    It is 2019, and the long winded bear market seems to be 
                    behind us, but privacy and the battle for free speech, and 
                    the battle of returning power to the individual is still ongoing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The old world order has already gone out and declared cryptocurrencies 
                    a national threat (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-15/mnuchin-plans-briefing-on-cryptocurrency-regulatory-issues), 
                    in a move that actually further legitimizes cryptocurrencies, by giving 
                    them more recognition in their power and potential.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What the old powers are not aware of though, and why they think it is reasonable 
                    and a good idea to go at war with them, is because they simply do not understand 
                    the very fundamentals that lie beneath them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's for a brief moment take a quick look at what hacking bounties are, and why 
                    the biggest of them all has not been cracked after 10 years of existence. You 
                    see, you can easily go to Amazon, Google, Ebay, Tesla or any other company that 
                    runs on its own software and find bounties they will happily pay out to you, 
                    given that you can find vulnerabilities in their systems, and then show them 
                    how you did it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This allows for companies to access hundreds of thousands of developers all 
                    across the world to have an honest look at their systems, find vulnerabilities, 
                    report them in, and get paid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bitcoin is in this regard, the biggest bounty of them all, currently worth a 
                    staggering $ 193 Billion at the time of writing this article. If anyone, 
                    government, individual or group, would be able to hack it, then they would 
                    immediately have rose to the top of the richest in world. Surpassing every 
                    single human being on this planet.
                </p>
                <h3>Bitcoin has never been hacked, shutdown or stopped working, why?</h3>
                <p>
                    Well this is the beauty of Satoshi's original vision, and the algorithm he 
                    subsequently produced, Proof of Work, and which is the algorithm behind 
                    Bitcoin that allows it to operate and not be hacked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Governments and individuals who are not familiar with this technology, can 
                    easily be deceived into thinking that they can simply "ban" it, and then be 
                    one and for all rid of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's also another theory though, and that is that they are pushing this 
                    news and agenda only to further push the price down, so they can as we say: 
                    "buy the dip", before loading in good news and accepting Bitcoin and other 
                    crypto currencies as legitimate payment systems. This is in many regards a 
                    make it or break it deal for the U.S, if they ban, they will be left behind, 
                    if they don't, then they might be able to keep staying in the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Satoshi's original algorithm though, PoW(Proof-of-work), will and can be 
                    hacked once quantum computing is out, although Bitcoin is the most 
                    transparent and robust system to date, it won't stand a chance to quantum 
                    computers due to its PoW algorithm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is in many regards where DAPS comes in(Decentralized, Anonymous, Payment System). 
                    With it's one of a kind hybrid chain that sports Bulletproofs(our own code),  
                    PoA(harpocrates protocol, our very own invention), PoSv3, RingCT(our own code), 
                    Masternodes and multi-sig wallets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the nature of the technologies coming together, our chain will be quantum proof, 
                    as it is not based on how much computing power you have to generate a block, but rather 
                    on luck(PoSv3), and a robust backbone through Masternodes that has a third party that 
                    checks that everything is right (PoA).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To read more about how our system works, you can check out our Whitepaper here: 
                    https://officialdapscoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/whitepaper.pdf
                </p>
                <h3>So where is privacy going, and what are the battles that lie ahead?</h3>
                <p>
                    Well for one, once DAPS main-net is out, the whole discussion around financial 
                    privacy, with anonymous transactions on a large and scalable system, will be done 
                    and over with. We in simple terms solved it, and it is groundbreaking to say the least.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our system will have been through two separate test-nets(with over 100 participants in 
                    each) and a thorough audit done by Red4Sec themselves
                    (https://officialdapscoin.com/daps-coin-appoints-red4sec-for-code-security-audit/) 
                    before it's launch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Our test-nets already took place earlier this year, and we are about halfway 
                    through our audit at the time of this writing.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This firmly assures investors and privacy minded individuals that a truly Decentralized and 
                    Anonymous Payment System will be in place. One that does exactly what it says on the paper, 
                    with nothing based on hype, but rather on facts and tech.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the DAPS way, we do things thorough, and we do them right. We will also begin to 
                    build out an entire eco-system on-top of our chain once it is released.
                </p>
                <h3>So what are the battles that lie ahead?</h3>
                <p>
                    Governments and corporations across the world are trying their best to keep a watchful 
                    eye on our every move. With (main-net released)financial freedom out of the way, and in 
                    many regards finally returned to the individual and masses, DAPS will shift its focus onto 
                    other areas.
                </p>
                <h3>Our battles do not only lie within one sector, but across multiple.</h3>
                <p>
                    We will be working on medical solutions, corporate B2B solutions, voting solutions(that 
                    would allow for direct democracy to take place) and other sensitive areas. We will of 
                    course also be expanding into strategic areas and working on getting the right partners 
                    to help with our worldwide expansion, although once DAPS is live, it will be so on a 
                    worldwide scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other battles are of course freedom of speech, and our basic human rights that are 
                    challenged daily across the world now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just last year a journalist was killed in what many have called "a rogue operation" by 
                    the Saudi family(https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45812399).
                    Jamal Khashoggi, a US based journalist walked into their embassy in Istanbul and was 
                    immediately murdered on foreign soil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>An American journalist</strong>, was <strong>murdered</strong> on foreign soil, 
                    for criticising a <strong>foreign government</strong>. 
                    Take a moment and let that sink in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And this is not only happening with, or in Saudi Arabia, but just in Mexico alone, 
                    7 journalists have been killed so far this year
                    (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/13/mexico-norma-sarabia-death-seventh-journalist-murdered).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also have journalists getting murdered and threatened in Europe
                    (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/16/daphne-caruana-galizia-murder-charged-three-malta).
                </p>
                <p>
                    So it is safe to say that once DAPS is out, we will begin to work on providing solutions for 
                    people who work in such sensitive areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The world is in many ways dictated and ran by unfair systems that have been set-up to protect 
                    the people at the top. And they work together across country borders and rules, all to protect 
                    each others businesses and relations amongst each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And this is all based on a system with fractional banking and a "Federal Bank" that can print 
                    money when they see fit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once DAPS is released, people all over the world will have a way to transact outside of this system, 
                    and effectively kill it without a single bullet being fired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DAPS is coming, and it is coming soon!
                </p>
