        <h3 class="mt-2 underLine">South Korean Ponzi Scheme</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">Investors in South Korea, mostly senior citizens, were defrauded of $18.7 million 
          after they were promised that the M-token they were purchasing would grow 600 percent 
          in value. 56,000 people were scammed. The fraud was uncovered by South Korean authorities 
          after they applied machine learning algorithms to detect keywords and phrases commonly used 
          by those conducting ponzi schemes.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-2 underLine">ICO Fraud in Canada</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Kevin Hobbs and Lisa Chang are facing civil asset forfeiture in British Columbia based on the 
          allegation that they defrauded their investors of $30 million. After launching the FUEL token, 
          they told their investors that their cryptocurrency would grow substantially in value. 
          They are accused of using investor funds for purchasing SUVs, a townhouse, and gambling.

        <p class="mt-2">
          Several Taiwanese men have been accused of defrauding 1,000 investors of $51 million. 
          Investors were promised 335 percent returns, but they received nothing. Those responsible are 
          facing several years in prison. In response to this ponzi scheme, the Taiwanese government 
          has introduced amendments to the Money Laundering Control Act and the Terrorism Financing 
          Prevention Act.
